EnergySpectrumReconstruction_1 : For particles having, after a FILTER, an incident kinetic energy such that they STOP within the detector.



EnergySpectrumReconstruction_2 : For particles having, after a FILTER, a sufficient kinetic energy to TRAVERSE the detector.



EnergySpectrumReconstruction_3 : For particles having an incident kinetic energy such that they STOP within the detector, without any filter.
